      worldwide as of 2025, making him one of the highest-grossing film actors
      of all time. Holland's career began at the age of nine, when he enrolled

      to audition for a role in Billy Elliot the Musical at London's Victoria

      play against-type roles in the crime dramas The Devil All the Time (2020)
      and Cherry (2021). Holland has additionally directed the short film Tweet
